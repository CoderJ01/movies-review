# MEAN Stack Movies Review

## Purpose

This website is designed to allow users to login and review popular movies. The creation of this website helps instill basic concepts involving MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. If you like to learn how to implement the MEAN stack by hands-on learning, then purchase the book “Beginning MEAN Stack” by Greg Lim ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-MongoDB-Express-Angular-Node-js/dp/B09CRTYYL4/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1663297205&sr=8-1)). 

Be sure to not copy and paste the code from a site you find online. Diligently type the code directly from the book so that you can more effectively absorb the concepts. Also, remember that, along with MongoDB Atlas’ network, Node.js packages are constantly being updated. Therefore, you may run into challenges when attempting to deploy the site to a PAAS (e.g. Heroku).  

Good luck!
